<h1> EEG-Based Imagined Speech Detection using SVM Classifier | Academic Project Jan 2024 – July 2024 </h1> 
• Trained and implemented an SVM classifier to recognize three words: ’Hello’, ’Stop’, and ’Thank you’. <br> 
• Integrated the model into a Raspberry Pi for product development. <br> 
• Analyzed over 4000 EEG readings for feature extraction. <br> 
• Developed a bionic arm to demonstrate the project’s application.
